# Cryptography_Lab7
This lab focuses on the implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), one of the earliest and most influential symmetric-key block ciphers in modern cryptography. The objective of the experiment is to understand how DES performs encryption and decryption on 64-bit data blocks using a 56-bit secret key. In this lab, the DES algorithm is implemented in Python using a simple library-based approach, demonstrating how plaintext is converted into ciphertext and then recovered back through decryption. The experiment helps students understand key concepts such as symmetric-key encryption, block ciphers, permutations, Feistel rounds, and the overall working mechanism of DES. By running the provided program, the user can input a key and plaintext to observe how DES transforms the data, giving practical insight into how classical encryption techniques secure communication. Although DES is no longer considered secure for modern applications due to its small key size, studying it provides a strong foundation for understanding more advanced cryptographic systems like AES and 3DES. This lab reinforces theoretical knowledge through hands-on practice and builds a deeper understanding of cryptographic operations.
